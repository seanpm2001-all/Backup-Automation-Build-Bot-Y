# Error handling

Error handling is coming soon, and is a work-in-progress (WIP) planned features include:

## GitHub upload limit warnings

Warns you when a repository reaches 75 GiB to 99.9 GiB in size.

## Debugging

* When a commit files, the script will retry after 10 seconds.

* When something goes really wrong, an error log will be sent, and options to retry will be displayed, such as:

> * Rename files and retry (this will remove certain characters from certain places of the file/folder name)

> * Retry normally

* Other/coming soon
