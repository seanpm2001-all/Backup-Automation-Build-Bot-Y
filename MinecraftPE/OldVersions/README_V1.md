# Minecraft Pocket Edition backup tool

I recently got access to a huge datapack of all my Minecraft Pocket Edition backups again. The task is far too cumbersome to do by hand, and I would never keep up. I feel like automation is the way to go on this, as there is no way I can keep up with an additional 120+ commits per day, along with over 3 thousands commits that have piled up.

I currently don't have a place to store the data online, I will link to it [here](https://www.example.com) when I find a way to do so (other than local, which doesn't work on global)
