# Automation ground rules

1. Not everything needs to be automated, you will replace yourself doing this, and some things also just can't be automated yet.

2. Don't automate a task that will take less time in the long run to do by hand in a 6 month period than it would take to make the task automated.

3. Don't rely on automation for everything, or else programs will become the quality of a Google Translate translation that has been run through 1-1000+ different languages.

4. More rules coming soon
